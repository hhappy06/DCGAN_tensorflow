# DCGAN_tensorflow
My practice about DCGAN ([Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)) using tensorflow.<br>
Thanks to https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow and https://github.com/MasazI/dcgan

##Use
> run 'python mnist_process.py' to create mnist samples<br>
> run 'train_dcgan.py' to train the DCGAN<br>
